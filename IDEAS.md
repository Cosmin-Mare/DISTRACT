Ideas
**- Notifications (PFP, Content?)**
- Calls (PFP, Name, Duration of call)
**- Multiple UI screens for like subways surfers vid and like games and stuff to keep u distracted in the app**
- Random sounds (Will max out volume)
**- Chatbot that gives one word responses**
**- random alarm setter**
**- translate page but you can only input numbers**

Access
- Access to calandar
- Access to alarms

~~~User flow
1. User downloads the app through Testflight or APK
2. When the kapp is opened, it asks for a few inputs and permissions
    a. What is your name
    b. How old are you (If u18, spam during 9am-3pm, during weekdays; school hours)
    c. On the link that is opened, click add. (Flow for shortcuts, will make more sense later, iPHONE ONLY!!, WILL WORK DIFF FOR ANDROID)
    d. App asks for permissions 
        IOS (Calandar, Alarms, Access to library?, Access to location, Access to microphone) 
        ANDROID ()
    Finally, open main app interface, looks scrappy, should have an instagram like interface, one tab for the chatbot, one tab for settings (useless toggles and buttons), tab for total time spent, amount of notificactions sent, amount of calls sent and amount of sounds played.~~~
